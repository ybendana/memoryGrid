Project Description:

Let's have some fun and implement a game called Memory Grid.  The game starts by
presenting a grid (N by M grid) with a subset of the elements highlighted to the
end user.

After a brief time, the grid will be flipped over, with all the elements reset
and no longer highlighted.

The user is then asked to click the positions of the cells in the grid that were
highlighted, within a set period of time.

If the user selects the correct cells, he or she will be taken on to the next
stage of the game where a more challenging level is presented, by either
increasing the number of the highlighted cells or by increasing the grid size,
or both. The position of the highlighted cells should change with each new game
level.

If the user does not guess correctly, we will reset the cells but stay at the
same level of difficulty.

Game play will continue until the user cannot complete a level, or has reached
the end of the available options.

This should be a dynamic, front-end only web app. You should try to use the best
of javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and whatever javascript / CSS framework you would
like. You should honor the "Honor Code" and do not copy if you find existing
examples on the web. We're looking for how you architect, organize and execute
this from a coding point of view.
